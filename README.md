## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
- For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
- This project provides an application for this company to determine: 
-- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
-- How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Dataset used for this project is train.csv.
